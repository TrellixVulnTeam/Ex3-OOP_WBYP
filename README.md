There are 3 parts to the task:

-The first part: Represents a positive directional weighted graph.

 -DiGraph: Represents a positive directional weighted graph.
 
 -Node_data: Represents a Node and his attributes-key,tag,weight,info,map.
 
-The second part: 

 -GraphAlgo: Represents a Directed (positive) Weighted Graph Theory Algorithms.
