The third assignment in OPP course

- Names: Saar Barel & Almog Reuveny.

In this assignment we built a directional weighted graph in Python

Example:

There are 3 parts to the task:

-The first part: Represents a positive directional weighted graph.

 -DiGraph: Represents a positive directional weighted graph.
 
 -Node_data: Represents a Node and his attributes-key,tag,weight,info,map.
 
-The second part: 

 -GraphAlgo: Represents a Directed (positive) Weighted Graph Theory Algorithms.
 
 -The third part: In this section you can see the results of the comparisons between Python, Java (our cod for Ex2) and NetworkX. 

  The results show the running times and the differences between them.
